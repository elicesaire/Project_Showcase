            <h2>Thank you and welcome to my project showcase</h2>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in florida with a hatiain background, pretty much lived here in Jacksonville
                my whole life. My burning passion for technology sparked when my Dad first bought our family computer. I knew little at the
                time but it was very alluring to see him tinker and build the computer from the ground up. Later he would go on to do other things like
                set up a sound system in the living room and ever since then i've been hooked on tech stuff in general. it wasn't until 
                sophmore year of highschool that i began to dive deep onto the software side of things when a close friend of mine got me into homebrewing 
                our personal game systems, at this time it was the 3ds, but we later went to homebrewing playstation devices. Homebrewing to simply put is
                just a bunch of file manipulation and exploiting "weaknesses" the console had, but man it would be really cool if i could program my own software
                to make it do whatever i wanted it to do.... So thats why im here majoring in info tech learning how to program various things and whatnot.
